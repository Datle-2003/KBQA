Q: Who was the Soviet Leader during WWII that held his governmental position after September 14, 1953?
Golden Entity: ['Soviet Union', 'World War II']
Thought: Let's first decouple this complex problem into several simple sub-problem triples: (target people, lead, Soviet Union), (target people, participate, World War II), (target people, hold governmental position after September 14, 1953). Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "lead the government" in the sub-graph of the entity "Soviet Union".
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e ns:type.object.name "Soviet Union"@en }', semantic="leader/president/governor")
Observation: [("Joseph Stalin", government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.jurisdiction_of_office, ?e), (?e, location.country.form_of_government, "Parliamentary republic"), (?e, government.governmental_jurisdiction.government_positions, "General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), ("United Nations", organization.organization.founders, ?e), ("Parliamentary republic", government.form_of_government.countries, ?e), (?e, government.governmental_jurisdiction.government, "Government of the Soviet Union"), (?e, government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials -> government.government_position_held.office_holder, "Joseph Stalin"), ("Premier", government.government_office_category.officeholders -> government.government_position_held.jurisdiction_of_office, ?e), ("General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union", government.government_office_or_title.jurisdiction, ?e), (?e, government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials -> government.government_position_held.office_position_or_title, "Premier of the Soviet Union")]
Thought: "government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials -> government.government_position_held.office_holder" is the predicate pair I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "participate" in the sub-graph of the entity "World War II".
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Soviet Union"@en . ?e0 ns:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials ?c . ?c ns:government.government_position_held.office_holder ?e . }', semantic="participate/engage in/join in war")
Observation: [(?e, military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts, "World War II"), ("World War II", military.military_conflict.military_personnel_involved, ?e), (?e, user.alonm.default_domain.revolutionary.participated_in_revolution, "October Revolution"), (?e, military.military_commander.military_commands -> military.military_command.military_combatant, "Soviet Union"), (?e, military.military_commander.military_commands -> military.military_command.military_conflict, "Battle of Berlin"), ("Soviet Union", military.military_combatant.military_commanders -> military.military_command.military_commander, ?e), ("Battle of Berlin", military.military_conflict.commanders -> military.military_command.military_commander, ?e), (?e, military.military_person.service -> military.military_service.to_date, "1946"^^xsd:gYear), ("Perestroika", time.event.people_involved, ?e), (?e, military.military_person.service -> military.military_service.from_date, "1941"^^xsd:gYear)]
Thought: "military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts" is the predicate I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "hold governmental position after" in the sub-graph.
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Soviet Union"@en . ?e0 ns:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials ?c . ?c ns:government.government_position_held.office_holder ?e . ?e ns:military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts ?e1 . ?e1 ns:type.object.name "World War II"@en . }', semantic="hold governmental position after")
Observation: [(?e, government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.to, "1964-10-14"^^xsd:date), (?e, government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.from, "1953-09-14"^^xsd:date), ("Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union", government.governmental_body.members -> government.government_position_held.office_holder, ?e), (?e, government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.jurisdiction_of_office, "Soviet Union"), (?e, government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.governmental_body, "Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), ("Soviet Union", government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials -> government.government_position_held.office_holder, ?e), (?e, government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.office_position_or_title, "General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), ("General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union", government.government_office_or_title.office_holders -> government.government_position_held.office_holder, ?e), (?e, government.politician.party -> government.political_party_tenure.party, "Communist Party of the Soviet Union"), ("Communist Party of the Soviet Union", government.political_party.politicians_in_this_party -> government.political_party_tenure.politician, ?e)]
Thought: "government.politician.government_positions_held -> government.government_position_held.from" is the predicate pair I want. Now, I have all the information I need. I can construct the SPARQL query.
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Soviet Union"@en . ?e0 ns:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials ?y . ?y ns:government.government_position_held.office_holder ?x . ?x ns:military.military_person.participated_in_conflicts ?conflict . ?conflict ns:type.object.name "World War II"@en . ?x ns:government.politician.government_positions_held ?c . ?c ns:government.government_position_held.from ?from . FILTER (?from > "1953-09-14"^^xsd:dateTime) . }')
Observation: ['Leonid Brezhnev']
Thought: The observation is the answer I want.
Action: Done.
