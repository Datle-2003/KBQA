Q: What pro athlete who started his career latest was a Falcons 2012 quarterback?
Thought: Let's first decouple this complex problem into several simple sub-problem triples: (Falcons, has a member, target athlete), (target athlete, serving time, 2012), (target athlete, serving position, quarterback). According to my knowledge, the entity name of "Falcons" in Freebase may be "Atlanta Falcons". Next, I need to search for a node meaning "Atlanta Falcons".
Action: SearchNodes("Atlanta Falcons")

They are a ...', '"Atlanta Falcons Cheerleaders" | Description: The Atlanta Falcons Cheerleaders are the cheerleading squad of the Atlanta Falcons.

Thought: "Atlanta Falcons" may be the node I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "has a member" in the sub-graph.
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e ns:type.object.name "Atlanta Falcons"@en }', semantic="team member/play in a team/roster in a team")
Observation: [("Freddie Falcon", sports.mascot.team, ?e), (?e, sports.sports_team.roster -> sports.sports_team_roster.player, "Chase Coffman"), ("Chase Coffman", sports.pro_athlete.teams -> sports.sports_team_roster.team, ?e), (?e, sports.sports_team.sport, "American football"), ("American football", sports.sport.teams, ?e), ("Tight end", sports.sports_position.players -> sports.sports_team_roster.team, ?e), ("Atlanta", sports.sports_team_location.teams, ?e), (?e, sports.sports_team.roster -> sports.sports_team_roster.position, "Tight end"), (?e, sports.sports_team.roster -> sports.sports_team_roster.from, "2012"^^xsd:gYear), ("Georgia Dome", sports.sports_facility.teams, ?e)]
Thought: "sports.sports_team.roster -> sports.sports_team_roster.player" is the predicate pair meaning "player of a team". Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "serving position" in the sub-graph.
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e ns:type.object.name "Atlanta Falcons"@en . }', semantic="play/serve position")
Observation: [(?e, sports.sports_team.roster -> sports.sports_team_roster.position, "Outside linebacker"), (?e, user.szaijan.fantasy_football.player.position, "Defensive Unit"), ("Defensive Unit", user.szaijan.fantasy_football.position.player, ?e), (?e, sports.sports_team.location, "Atlanta"), (?e, american_football.football_team.historical_coaching_staff -> american_football.football_historical_coach_position.position, "Head coach"), ("Greg Knapp", american_football.football_coach.coaching_history -> american_football.football_historical_coach_position.team, ?e), ("Mike Smith", american_football.football_coach.current_team_head_coached, ?e), ("Mike Smith", american_football.football_coach.current_team_head_coached -> user.szaijan.fantasy_football.player.nfl_team, ?e), ("Head coach", american_football.football_coach_position.coaches_holding_this_position -> american_football.football_historical_coach_position.team, ?e), ("National Football Conference", american_football.football_conference.divisions -> american_football.football_division.teams, ?e)]
Thought: "sports.sports_team.roster -> sports.sports_team_roster.position" is the predicate pair meaning "the position of the player". Now, I have all the information I need. According to the Freebase schema, I need to add ".from" and ".to" to the predicate "sports.sports_team_roster" to constrain the year in "2012". Now, I have all the information I need. I can construct the SPARQL query.
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Atlanta Falcons"@en . ?e0 ns:sports.sports_team.roster ?c . ?c ns:sports.sports_team_roster.position ?position . ?position ns:type.object.name "Quarterback"@en . ?c ns:sports.sports_team_roster.player ?x . ?c ns:sports.sports_team_roster.from ?from . FILTER(xsd:datetime(?from) <= "2012-12-31"^^xsd:dateTime) ?c ns:sports.sports_team_roster.to ?to . FILTER(xsd:datetime(?to) >= "2012-12-31"^^xsd:dateTime) } ORDER BY DESC(?from) LIMIT 1')
Observation: ['Matt Ryan']
Thought: The observation is the answer I want.
Action: Done.
