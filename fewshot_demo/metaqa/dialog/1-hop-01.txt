Q: how popular of a movie was Grand Hotel
Thought: Let's first decouple this problem into: (Grand Hotel, popularity, ?). Next, I need to search for a node meaning "Grand Hotel".
Action: SearchNodes("Grand Hotel")
Observation: ['"Grand Hotel" | A movie node', '"The Grand Budapest Hotel" | A movie node', '"Hotel" | A movie node', '"hotel" | A tag', '"Grand Isle" | A movie node', '"Grand Prix" | A movie node', '"Grand Masti" | A movie node', '"The Grand" | A movie node', '"Grand Canyon" | A movie node', '"Grand Piano" | A movie node']
Thought: "Grand Hotel" is the movie node I am looking for. Next, according to the KG schema, has_imdb_votes is the most relevent one. Now I can construct the SPARQL query.
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?e <name> "Grand Hotel" . ?e <has_imdb_votes> ?x . }')
Observation: ['famous']
Thought: The observation is the answer I want.
Action: Done.
