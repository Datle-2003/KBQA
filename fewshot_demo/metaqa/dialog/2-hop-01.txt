Q: which movies share the same actor of The Strangers
Thought: Let's first decouple this complex problem into several simple sub-problem triples: (some actors, actor of, The Strangers), (some actors, actor of, the target movies). Next, I need to search for a node meaning "The Strangers".
Action: SearchNodes("The Strangers")
Observation: ['"The Strangers" | A movie node', '"The Stranger" | A movie node', '"The Strangler" | A movie node', '"Three Strangers" | A movie node', '"Intimate Strangers" | A movie node', '"Between Strangers" | A movie node', '"The Stranger\'s Return" | A movie node', '"The Business of Strangers" | A movie node', '"The Comfort of Strangers" | A movie node', '"The Night Strangler" | A movie node']
Thought: "The Strangers" is the movie I want. Next, according to the KG schema, starred_actors is the most relevent one. The question asks about "share the same actor", so I need to find the actor of "The Strangers" first, and then find the movies that share the same actor.
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?movie <name> "The Strangers" . ?movie <starred_actors> ?actor . ?x <starred_actors> ?actor . FILTER(?x != ?movie) }')
Observation: ['Armageddon', 'Barefoot', "Cookie's Fortune", 'Heavy', 'Kitchen Party', 'My Life Without Me', 'Onegin', 'Reign Over Me', 'Super', 'The 24th Day', 'The Incredible Hulk', 'The Ledge', 'Underworld']
Thought: The observation is the answer I want.
Action: Done.
