Q: what character did natalie portman play in star wars?
Thought: Let's first decouple this complex problem into several simple sub-problem triples: (natalie portman, play character in a film, target character), (natalie portman, play movie, star wars). According to my knowledge, the entity name of "natalie portman" in Freebase is "Natalie Portman". So, I need to search a node about "Natalie Portman".
Action: SearchNodes("Natalie Portman")
Observation: ['"Natalie Portman" | Description: Natalie Portman is an Israeli-born American actress, producer, and director. Her first role was in t...', '"Natalie Portmanm" | No description.', '"Natalie Portman (demo)" | No description.', '"Natalie Portman Intro" | No description.', '"Natalie Portman Photos" | No description.', '"Natalie Portman Pictures" | No description.', '"Natalie Natalia" | Description: Natalie Natalia is a novel by Nicholas Mosley first published in 1971 about a middle-aged British MP...', '"Daisy Fuentes; Natalie Portman" | No description.', '"Dear Natalie Portman (skit)" | No description.', '"Portrait of Natalie Portman" | No description.']
Thought: "Natalie Portman" is the node I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "play character in a film" in the sub-graph of the entity "Natalie Portman".
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e ns:type.object.name "Natalie Portman"@en . }', semantic="play character in a film")
Observation: [(?e, film.actor.film -> film.performance.character, "Inés"), ("Mathilda", film.film_character.portrayed_in_films -> film.performance.actor, ?e), (?e, film.actor.film -> film.performance.character_note, "Segment "Mira Nair""), (?e, film.person_or_entity_appearing_in_film.films -> film.personal_film_appearance.film, "The Stars of Star Wars"), ("A Tale of Love and Darkness", film.film.starring -> film.performance.actor, ?e), (?e, film.person_or_entity_appearing_in_film.films -> film.personal_film_appearance.type_of_appearance, "Him/Herself"), (?e, film.actor.film -> film.performance.film, "Everyone Says I Love You"), (?e, film.producer.film, "Jane Got a Gun"), (?e, film.director.film, "New York, I Love You"), (?e, film.writer.film, "New York, I Love You")]
Thought: "film.actor.film -> film.performance.character" means "an actor play a character in a film", "film.actor.film -> film.performance.film" means "an actor play a film". Now, I have all the information I need. I can construct the SPARQL query.
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { FILTER ( NOT EXISTS { ?x ns:type.object.name ?xn . } || EXISTS { ?x ns:type.object.name ?xn .

Observation: []
Thought: The observation is empty, there is something wrong with the query. The node "Star Wars" has not been verified. I need to enumerate all the films and find the one about "Star Wars".
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Natalie Portman"@en . ?e0 ns:film.actor.film ?y . ?y ns:film.performance.film ?x . }')

Thought: "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" is the film I want. Now, I have all the information I need. I can construct the SPARQL query.
Action: ExecuteSPARQL('SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?e0 ns:type.object.name "Natalie Portman"@en . ?e0 ns:film.actor.film ?y . ?y ns:film.performance.film ?e1 . ?e1 ns:type.object.name "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"@en . ?y ns:film.performance.character ?x . }')

Thought: The observation is the answer I want.

Q: who does the uk trade with?
Thought: Let's first decouple this complex problem into several simple sub-problem triples: (the uk, trade with, target entity). According to my knowledge, the entity name of "the uk" in Freebase may be "the United Kingdom". So, I need to search for a node meaning "United Kingdom".

Thought: "the United Kingdom" is not in the list. "United Kingdom" may be the node I want. Next, I need to search for a predicate meaning "trade with" in the sub-graph of the entity "United Kingdom".
Action: SearchGraphPatterns('SELECT ?e WHERE { ?e ns:type.object.name "United Kingdom"@en }', semantic="a country trades with another country")

Thought: There is no predicate meaning "trade with". Maybe I should try other keywords.
